This paper introduces the WPR,  a generic routing scheme for CGs, which guarantees packet delivery and provides: minimal routing, path diversity and fault-tolerance. As far as these authors known, the WPR is the first routing scheme with these features. The core of the WPR is a novel mechanism of fault-tolerance, which  support multiple failures and provides minimal routing in spite of nodes do not keep a global record of failures. Through a complexity analysis, it was shown that the WPR stays competitive with respect to  the state of the art on generic routing in CGs. 

There are several future research lines on which this work can be taken as a base. The future work can be gathered in three main aspects: 1) designing new network architectures based on CGs and the WPR; 2) deploying the WPR in wireless sensor networks and; 3) applying the \textit{word-processing approach} to design distributed algorithms for CGs, which solve problems different from the routing problem, e.g. consensus, leader election etc.
