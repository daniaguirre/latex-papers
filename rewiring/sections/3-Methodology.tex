\subsection{General operation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequency of use of dynamic links during the exploration phase ($f_e$).
    \item Frequency of visits to candidate nodes during the exploration phase ($f_n$).

\subsection{Rewiring mechanism}

The rewiring mechanism is a distributed process executed a determined number of cycles. A cycle of the rewiring mechanism consist of the following phases:

\subsubsection{Exploration}

During this phase, each node sequentially sends twenty tracer packets to arbitrary destination nodes. Packets are routed applying compass routing. Destination nodes respond to a tracer packet with an acknowledgment packet informing about the path followed by the tracer packet.
When a node receives an acknowledgment packet, it updates its vectors $f_e$ and $f_n$ with the information. A node finishes its exploration phase when it has received all the acknowledgements packets from all destinations.

\subsubsection{Exploration synchronization}

This phase starts when the coordinator node has finished its exploration phase. Then it starts a PIF algorithm to spread messages asking if the rest of nodes have finished its exploration phase. When the coordinator node receives a response of all the nodes in the network,  it starts a PI algorithm to spread messages notifying that nodes must start its rewiring phase.

\subsubsection{Rewiring}

Each node starts its rewiring phase when it receives a notification from the coordinator. Then, the notified node uses the information in its vectors $f_e$ and $f_n$ to take a rewiring decision according to one of the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rule 1}. The node rewires its least used dynamic link (according with $f_e$) to the most visited node (according to $f_n$).
    \item \textbf{Rule 2}. The node rewires its least used dynamic link (according with $f_e$) to the first node at distance 2 from it. Said node is the first node in $f_n$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Rewiring synchronization}

Analogous to the \textit{Exploration Synchronization phase}, this phase starts when the coordinator node has finished its rewiring phase. Then it starts a PIF algorithm to spread messages asking if the rest of nodes have finished its rewiring phase. When the coordinator node receives a response of all the nodes in the network, it starts a PI algorithm to spread messages notifying that the cycle has finished and nodes must start a new cycle.
