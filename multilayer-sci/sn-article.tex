\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

The Introduction section, of referenced text \cite{bib1} expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

Springer Nature does not impose a strict layout as standard however authors are advised to check the individual requirements for the journal they are planning to submit to as there may be journal-level preferences. When preparing your text please also be aware that some stylistic choices are not supported in full text XML (publication version), including coloured font. These will not be replicated in the typeset article if it is accepted. 

\section{Data and methods}\label{sec2}

\subsection{Data}

Data included in this study was retrieved from the Scopus database via the Scopus API using the \textit{pybliomterics} library for Python \cite{Rose2019}. We have searched for articles published between 2012 and 2021, and written by authors affiliated with one of the three major Mexican universities, i.e the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico (IPN) and the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM). The collected data consists of metadata on $74,400$ papers, whose coauthor affiliations are distributed as follows: UNAM $65\%$, IPN $28\%$, UAM $2\%$, coauthors of the remaining $5\%$ of the papers are affiliated with 2 o 3 of the mentioned institutions, see Figure  \ref{fig1_papersauthors}. As is shown in figures \ref{fig1_papersauthors} and \ref{fig2_professors_dist},  the distribution of coauthor affiliations is proportional to the number of associate and professors per institution \cite{AnuarioUNAM2021,AnuarioIPN2021,AnuarioUAM2021}.

\begin{figure}[h]%
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig1_papersauthors.eps}
	\caption{Distribution of papers among the affiliations of their coauthors}\label{fig1_papersauthors}
\end{figure}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig2_professors_dist.eps}
	\caption{Number of associated and full professor per institutions}\label{fig2_professors_dist}
\end{figure}


In order to analyze the collaboration networks across different subject areas, we consider the All Science Journal Classification (ASJC) System, which is used in the Scopus database to classify journals and conference proceedings under the following four subject areas: life sciences, physical sciences, health sciences and social sciences. Figure \ref{fig3_papersareas} shows the distribution of papers among the different institutions and subject areas. It is important to mention that some papers are classified in more than one subject area, thus the sum of papers per area is greater than the number of papers of all four areas together.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Multilayer co-authorship networks}

A multilayer social network is given by a quadruple $M=(A,L,V,E)$, where $A$ is a set of actors (authors for this study), $L$ is a set of layers and $(V,E)$ is a graph such that  $V\subseteq A \times L$. Edges in the set $E$ are classified as intralayer and interlayer, where intralayer connects nodes in the same layer and interlayer connects the same nodes in different layers \cite{dickison_magnani_rossi_2016}.

We have applied a representation of multilayer co-authorship networks proposed in \cite{vasilyeva2021}, where nodes represent authors and the $i^{th}$ layer is formed by authors of articles co-written by $i$ authors. Thus intralayers links represent co-authorship relations and interlayers links connect the same author at different layers. Figure \ref{fig1} presents an example of four articles mapped in a multilayer co-authorship network.

\subsection{Basic metrics}

\subsubsection{Number of nodes and edges}
\subsubsection{Density}

\subsubsection{Number of connected components}

\subsubsection{Size of the largest connected component}

\subsubsection{Number of isolated nodes}


\subsection{Distance metrics}
\subsubsection{Diameter}
\textbf{Paths and distances}

Let $i$ and $j$ be two nodes in a network, a \textit{path} between $i$ and $j$ is a sequence of links that connect them. The number of links in a path is  called \textit{path length}. Then the distance between two nodes $i$ and $j$, denoted by $d_{ij}$ is equal to the length of the shortest path between them. A popular distance measure in co-authorship networks is the Erdös number of authors, which states the distance between a given author and the great mathematician Paul Erdös.

Finally, the diameter of a network, denoted by $d$, is the shortest distance between the two most distant nodes. In a co-authorship network, the diameter


\subsubsection{Average path legth}


\subsection{Centrality distributions}

\subsubsection{Degree centrality}
The degree of a node $i$, denoted bu $k_i$, is given by the number of nodes that are adjacent to it. In a co-authorship network, the degree of an author indicates the number of its coauthors. 

\subsubsection{Closeness centrality}
The closeness centrality of a node $i$, denoted by $g_i$, is given by the inverse sum of distances of node $i$ from all other, i.e.

\begin{equation}
	g_i=\frac{1}{\sum_{j\neq i}\ell _{ij}}.
\end{equation}

This metric determine how \textit{close} is an author to the rest of authors in a co-authorship network.

\subsubsection{Betweenness centrality}

Let $\sigma_{hj}$ be the number of shortest paths between every pair of nodes $h$ and $j$, except a node $i$, and let $\sigma_{hj}(i)\subseteq\sigma_{hj}$ be the number of these paths that pass through node $i$. The betweenness centrality of node $i$, denoted by $b_i$, is given by



\begin{equation}
	b_i=\displaystyle\sum_{h\neq i \neq j}\frac{\sigma_{hj}(i)}{\sigma_{hj}}.
\end{equation}

This metric indicates the fraction of all shortest paths in the networks that pass through a node $i$. If an author has a high betweenness centrality in a co-authorship network, then it occupies a special position due to it is important for the transmission of information across the network. Thus the betweennesss centrality captures the potential that author has to control the communication between the rest of authors in a co-authorship network.

\subsubsection{Harmonic centrality}

\subsubsection{Eigenvector centrality}

\subsubsection{Clustering coefficient}
\subsubsection{Core number}

\subsection{Community metrics}

\subsubsection{Number of communities}
\subsubsection{Minimum community size}

\subsubsection{Average community size}

\subsubsection{Imbalance}

\subsubsection{Size of the edge cut}

\section{Equations}\label{sec4}

Equations in \LaTeX\ can either be inline or on-a-line by itself (``display equations''). For
inline equations use the \verb+$...$+ commands. E.g.: The equation
$H\psi = E \psi$ is written via the command \verb+$H \psi = E \psi$+.

For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers)
one can use the equation or align environments:
\begin{equation}
\|\tilde{X}(k)\|^2 \leq\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\left\|\tilde{Y}_i(k)\right\|^2+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{q}\left\|\tilde{Z}_j(k)\right\|^2 }{p+q}.\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu \nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu \label{eq2}
\end{align}
Notice the use of \verb+\nonumber+ in the align environment at the end
of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on
lines where no equation numbers are required. The \verb+\label{}+ command
should only be used at the last line of an align environment where
\verb+\nonumber+ is not used.
\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}
The class file also supports the use of \verb+\mathbb{}+, \verb+\mathscr{}+ and
\verb+\mathcal{}+ commands. As such \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathscr{R}+
and \verb+\mathcal{R}+ produces $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathscr{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
respectively (refer Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsec2}).

\section{Tables}\label{sec5}

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put
footnotes inside tables you should use \verb+\footnotetext[]{...}+ tag.
The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables~\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}). 
For the corresponding footnotemark use \verb+\footnotemark[...]+

\begin{table}[h]

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single column width should be set to full text width. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table}+ environment. Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ environment. This environment puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double column width, use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable*}+.

\section{Figures}\label{sec6}

As per the \LaTeX\ standards you need to use eps images for \LaTeX\ compilation and \verb+pdf/jpg/png+ images for \verb+PDFLaTeX+ compilation. This is one of the major difference between \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images for \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+ can be generalized. The package used to insert images in \verb+LaTeX/PDFLaTeX+ is the graphicx package. Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:

%%=============================================%%

%% \bigskip command. please ignore this.       %%

\caption{This is a widefig. This is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption  this is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption}\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

In case of double column layout, the above format puts figure captions/images to single column width. To get spanned images, we need to provide \verb+\begin{figure*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{figure*}+.

For sample purpose, we have included the width of images in the optional argument of \verb+\includegraphics+ tag. Please ignore this. 

\section{Algorithms, Program codes and Listings}\label{sec7}

Packages \verb+algorithm+, \verb+algorithmicx+ and \verb+algpseudocode+ are used for setting algorithms in \LaTeX\ using the format:

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details before setting \verb+algorithm+ environment. For program codes, the ``program'' package is required and the command to be used is \verb+\begin{program}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{program}+. A fast exponentiation procedure:

\begin{program}
\BEGIN \\ %
  \FOR i:=1 \TO 10 \STEP 1 \DO
     |expt|(2,i); \\ |newline|() \OD %
\rcomment{Comments will be set flush to the right margin}
\WHERE
\PROC |expt|(x,n) \BODY
          z:=1;
          \DO \IF n=0 \THEN \EXIT \FI;
             \DO \IF |odd|(n) \THEN \EXIT \FI;
\COMMENT{This is a comment statement};
                n:=n/2; x:=x*x \OD;
             \{ n>0 \};
             n:=n-1; z:=z*x \OD;
          |print|(z) \ENDPROC
\END
\end{program}


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Calculate $y = x^n$}\label{algo1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $n \geq 0 \vee x \neq 0$
\Ensure $y = x^n$ 
\State $y \Leftarrow 1$
\If{$n < 0$}\label{algln2}
        \State $X \Leftarrow 1 / x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow -n$
\Else
        \State $X \Leftarrow x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow n$
\EndIf
\While{$N \neq 0$}
        \If{$N$ is even}
            \State $X \Leftarrow X \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N / 2$
        \Else[$N$ is odd]
            \State $y \Leftarrow y \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N - 1$

\section{Cross referencing}\label{sec8}

Environments such as figure, table, equation and align can have a label
declared via the \verb+\label{#label}+ command. For figures and table
environments use the \verb+\label{}+ command inside or just
below the \verb+\caption{}+ command. You can then use the
\verb+\ref{#label}+ command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider
the label declared for Figure~\ref{fig1} which is
\verb+\label{fig1}+. To cross-reference it, use the command 
\verb+Figure \ref{fig1}+, for which it comes up as
``Figure~\ref{fig1}''. 

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm~\ref{algo1} is \verb+\label{algln2}+. To cross-reference it, use the command \verb+\ref{algln2}+ for which it comes up as line~\ref{algln2} of Algorithm~\ref{algo1}.

\subsection{Details on reference citations}\label{subsec7}

Standard \LaTeX\ permits only numerical citations. To support both numerical and author-year citations this template uses \verb+natbib+ \LaTeX\ package. For style guidance please refer to the template user manual.

Here is an example for \verb+\cite{...}+: \cite{bib1}. Another example for \verb+\citep{...}+: \citep{bib2}. For author-year citation mode, \verb+\cite{...}+ prints Jones et al. (1990) and \verb+\citep{...}+ prints (Jones et al., 1990).

All cited bib entries are printed at the end of this article: \cite{bib3}, \cite{bib4}, \cite{bib5}, \cite{bib6}, \cite{bib7}, \cite{bib8}, \cite{bib9}, \cite{bib10}, \cite{bib11} and \cite{bib12}.

\section{Examples for theorem like environments}\label{sec10}

For theorem like environments, we require \verb+amsthm+ package. There are three types of predefined theorem styles exists---\verb+thmstyleone+, \verb+thmstyletwo+ and \verb+thmstylethree+ 

%%=============================================%%
%% For presentation purpose, we have included  %%
%% \bigskip command. please ignore this.       %%
%%=============================================%%
\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{19pc}|}
\hline
\verb+thmstyleone+ & Numbered, theorem head in bold font and theorem text in italic style \\\hline
\verb+thmstyletwo+ & Numbered, theorem head in roman font and theorem text in italic style \\\hline
\verb+thmstylethree+ & Numbered, theorem head in bold font and theorem text in roman style \\\hline
\end{tabular}

For mathematics journals, theorem styles can be included as shown in the following examples:

\begin{theorem}[Theorem subhead]\label{thm1}

Additionally a predefined ``proof'' environment is available: \verb+\begin{proof}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{proof}+. This prints a ``Proof'' head in italic font style and the ``body text'' in roman font style with an open square at the end of each proof environment. 

\begin{proof}
Example for proof text. Example for proof text. Example for proof text. Example for proof text. Example for proof text. Example for proof text. Example for proof text. Example for proof text. Example for proof text. Example for proof text.

For a quote environment, use \verb+\begin{quote}...\end{quote}+
\begin{quote}
Quoted text example. Aliquam porttitor quam a lacus. Praesent vel arcu ut tortor cursus volutpat. In vitae pede quis diam bibendum placerat. Fusce elementum

\section{Methods}\label{sec11}

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work. Authors are encouraged to include RIIDs where appropriate. 

\textbf{Ethical approval declarations} (only required where applicable) Any article reporting experiment/s carried out on (i)~live vertebrate (or higher invertebrates), (ii)~humans or (iii)~human samples must include an unambiguous statement within the methods section that meets the following requirements: 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Approval: a statement which confirms that all experimental protocols were approved by a named institutional and/or licensing committee. Please identify the approving body in the methods section

\item Accordance: a statement explicitly saying that the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations

\item Informed consent (for experiments involving humans or human tissue samples): include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardian/s
\end{enumerate}

If your manuscript includes potentially identifying patient/participant information, or if it describes human transplantation research, or if it reports results of a clinical trial then  additional information will be required. Please visit (\url{https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies}) for Nature Portfolio journals, (\url{https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/publishing-ethics/14214}) for Springer Nature journals, or (\url{https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies\#ethics+and+consent}) for BMC.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or `Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section `Results and Discussion' followed by a section `Conclusion'. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.
